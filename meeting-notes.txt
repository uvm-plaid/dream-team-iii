+ Keep trying to do last week's assignment

# 02/14/2018

Covered today:

+ Went over Ramy and Adam's SAT solving code. Great work both of you!

Next time:

- See the file SATEnv.hs for my solution for what I had in mind. Your homework
  for next week is to write a monadic version of my solution using the Reader
  monad. See the file for details and instructions.
- If you get stuck on something, feel free to ping me on Slack and I can help
  out.

# 02/07/2018

Covered today:

+ Monads, and examples of state monad and list monad
+ Starting code for the SAT example project
+ You should install hdevtools to interactively typecheck files.
  First, install stack

    http://haskellstack.org

  Then, tell stack to use your global ghc installation for its "global project"
  settings on your machine:

      stack config set system-ghc --global true

  (Described here:)

  https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/#i-already-have-ghc-installed-can-i-still-use-stack

  Then install hdevtools

      stack install hdevtools

  You may need to add ~/.local/bin to your path, by adding this to your .bashrc
  (or .zshrc, or whatever):

      export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

  My syntastic config looks like this in my .vimrc:

      " Make Syntastic always update the errors window
      let g:syntastic_always_populate_loc_list = 1
      let g:syntastic_auto_loc_list = 1
      let g:syntastic_check_on_open = 0
      let g:syntastic_check_on_wq = 0
    
  (I believe these are recommended settings from the syntastic install
  instructions)

  Get the Start.hs file running with hdevtools. Edit it to cause a type error
  and make sure it's reported in a vim buffer.

Next time:

- Implement a satisfiabilitiy function in Haskell that uses an environment
  rather than substitution for keeping track of "guessed" variable assignments.
  (Refer to notes from last time). Use Start.hs in the repo as a starting
  point.
- Re-read the monads chapter in LYAH, to reinforce concepts discussed in
  today's meeting.

# 01/31/2018

What we covered today:

+ we went over types, kinds, type classes, and the functor type class
+ we briefly discussed the first two sections of Yang et al’s “Finding and
  Understanding Bugs in C Compilers”

For next time:

- Read “Reflections on Trusting Trust” by Ken Thompson [1]
- Work through the Learn You a Haskell book up through chapter 13 “For a Few
  Monads More” (same goal as before)
- I want us to start building a naive SAT solver in Haskell, based on this blog
  post [2]
  * copy the datatype definition for Expr
  * define your own function for computing the set of variables that occur in
    an expression (rather than just the first free variable, shown in the blog
    post)
  * define an evaluation function which, given a mapping from variables to
    booleans, computes the truth value for a given formula.
  * e.g., an example expression (((1 /\ x) \/ (y /\ x) \/ 0) /\ y) and a
    mapping from variables to booleans (x := 0, y := 1) evaluates to 0, because
    (((1 /\ x) \/ (y /\ x) \/ 0) /\ y) = ((0 \/ 0 \/ 0) /\ 1) == (0 \/ 1) = 0.
- Feel free to work together and pair program
- We will look at the code everyone came up with together on a projector and
  discuss design decisions.
- I’m going to set up a slack channel for us to discuss research activity.
  Please install stack on your laptop and/or phone if you don’t already have
  it. I’ll send invites to the channel shortly.

# 01/22/2018

(Just Ramy)

+ You and I will meet Tuesdays 10:30-11:30
+ For each meeting, please prepare in LaTeX a short report on your progress
  since last week’s meeting. Print it out and we will discuss it together at the
  beginning of the meeting.
+ After each meeting I will email you summarizing the meeting and setting goals
  for next week.
+ We covered background and motivation for verified compilers and program
  analyzers.
+ We covered at a high level the goal of automatically proving that a function
  is monotonic
+ We covered at a high level the goal of automatically proving two
  set-theoretic functions are equal
+ We set goals for learning Haskell and monads

Goals for next week:

+ Work through the Learn You a Haskell book up through chapter 13 “For a Few
  Monads More”
+ Read sections 1 and 2 of Yang et al’s “Finding and Understanding Bugs in C
  Compilers” [1]. Come prepared with questions for anything in those sections
  that you didn’t understand.
