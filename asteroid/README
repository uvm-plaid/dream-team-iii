# Setup

Make sure your current directory is this directory, e.g.:

    cd asteroid

Set up a cabal sandbox:

    cabal sandbox init

Install dependencies for the project:

    cabal install --dependencies-only

# Building

To build the project:

    cabal build

To build project documentation:

    make docs

E.g., to see the local docs for the whole project open:

    docs/html/asteroid/index.html

in any web browser.

**Please build re-build documentation before you push any new code.**

The online documentation is at:

    https://uvm-plas.github.io/dream-team-iii/docs/

which pulls from this github repo's /docs folder (which is generated by `make
docs`).

# Running

Run the code in src/Main.hs with:

    make run
    
or `cabal run asteroid`.

Start an interpreter with 

    make repl
    
or `cabal exec -- ghci`.
